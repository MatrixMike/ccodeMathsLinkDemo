Readme file

demo created to show use of constants, #defines and #include files { in that order }
Could say Lesson 1 here

1. Start with :
printf("hi mike  %2d\n", 23);  // the 23 can be any number - for demo - including negatives
2. Add the #define line i.e. un comment it or type it
3. Create a file and include reference to it 

Notice that the compile line uses gcc as for me the alternative ( see /etc/alternatives ) does not assist me properly when I use 'tab complete'

Lesson 2 :
now add a for loop around the printf statement
